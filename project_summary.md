## Description
SkyMap is an artistic project that intends to chart the ephemeral nature of the sky. SkyMap is cartography of the 
skyâ€™s immateriality, focusing precisely in its changing nature, rather than its fixities. 

A classic mapping based only on space coordinates (lenghth, width and height) falls short of this project, 
which utilizes three main axis: space, time and color. 
Through these three variables, SkyMap is conceived as a platform for a network of SkyMappers that can portray the multiplicity of skies and generate mosaics limited by any combination of the three variables.
